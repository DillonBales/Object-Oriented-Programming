        "#### Problem 1: Class Creation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a class named `Car` with the following attributes:\n",
        "   - `brand` (string)\n",
        "   - `model` (string)\n",
        "   - `year` (integer)\n",
        "   - `mileage` (float)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 2: Object Instantiation\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instantiate three objects of the `Car` class with different values for the attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 3: Method Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Add a method named `display_info` to the `Car` class that prints information about the car, including brand, model, year, and mileage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 4: Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Create a new class named `ElectricCar` that inherits from the `Car` class. Add a new attribute `battery_capacity` (integer) to the `ElectricCar` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 5: Method Override\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Override the `display_info` method in the `ElectricCar` class to include information about the battery capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 6: Object Instantiation (ElectricCar)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Instantiate two objects of the `ElectricCar` class, providing values for all attributes, including the new `battery_capacity` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 7: Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Create instances of both the `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes and test the functionality of the `display_info` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 8: Additional Features (Optional)\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Add any additional features to the classes that you think would enhance their functionality. This could include methods for updating mileage, checking battery status, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Submission\n",
        "\n",
        "Submit a Python script or Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the classes and the testing code. Include comments to explain the purpose of each class, method, and any significant code block.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Ensure good code readability and documentation throughout your implementation."
