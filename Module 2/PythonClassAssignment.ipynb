        "#### Problem 1: Class Creation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a class named `Person` with the following attributes:\n",
        "   - `name` (string)\n",
        "   - `age` (integer)\n",
        "   - `location` (string)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 2: Object Instantiation\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instantiate three objects of the `Person` class with different values for the attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 3: Method Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Add a method named `greet` to the `Person` class that prints a greeting message including the person's name.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 4: Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Create a new class named `Student` that inherits from the `Person` class. Add a new attribute `student_id` (string) to the `Student` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 5: Method Override\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Override the `greet` method in the `Student` class to include the student's ID in the greeting message.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 6: Object Instantiation (Student)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Instantiate two objects of the `Student` class, providing values for all attributes, including the new `student_id` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 7: Display Information\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Write a function outside the classes that takes a `Person` or `Student` object as a parameter and displays all the information about that person or student.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 8: Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Create instances of both the `Person` and `Student` classes and test the functionality of the `greet` method and the display function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem 9: Additional Features (Optional)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Add any additional features to the classes that you think would enhance their functionality. This could include methods for modifying attributes, additional attributes, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Submission\n",
        "\n",
        "Submit a Python script or Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the classes and the testing code. Include comments to explain the purpose of each class, method, and any significant code block.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Make sure to follow best practices for code readability and documentation."
